In order to run efficiently and effectively, it needs peers, run by different people....and the more the better.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will describe how to create a Bitcoin \"full node\" (a Bitcoin server that contains the full blockchain and propagates transactions throughout the Bitcoin network via peers). This system *will not* mine for Bitcoins...it *will* keep the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network healthy and strong. For a detailed explanation for why this is important, read this article [about Bitcoin full nodes](https://medium.com/@lopp/bitcoin-nodes-how-many-is-enough-9b8e8f6fd2cf).\r\n\r\n## Why a Raspberry Pi?\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi is an inexpensive computing hardware platform that generates little heat, draws little power, and can run silently 24 hours a day without having to think about it. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nI decided to create my own Bitcoin full node on a Raspberry Pi. Being a good Bitcoin citizen means running a full node, in my opinion. I wanted to use a Raspberry Pi because it is low cost, generates little heat, draws little power, and can run \"in the basement\" silently without having to think about it.\r\n\r\nI am going to assume that if you are reading this to create your own Raspberry Pi bitcoin full node, then you already know a little bit about linux, electronics, and running command line tools like SSH. \r\n\r\n## Parts List  (total cost ~$80)\r\n\r\n* [Raspberry Pi 2 - Model B](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2358) (~$40)\r\n* [Raspberry Pi Case](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2285) (~$5)\r\n* [MicroSD card with 64 GB of storage](http://amzn.com/B00R7CSHWW) (~$25)\r\n* [Mirco USB charger that you can dedicate to the Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1995) (~$8)\r\n\r\n* (Temporarily you will need a keyboard and monitor that supports HDMI to make things easier. You don't need this technically, but it sure makes the initial config process much easier.)\r\n\r\n## Steps to Follow\r\n\r\n1. **Prepare the MicroSD Card:** The blockchain is growing quickly (30+ GBs at the time of this writing), so I felt 64 GB was a good size for the Raspberry Pi's storage. I suppose you could go for 128 GBs to be even more future-proof, if you are willing to spend the money. The MicroSD card will likely come formatted as exfat, instead of FAT32, but the Raspberry Pi needs FAT32. I recommend using the built-in tools on Windows or Mac OSX to format the MicroSD. If you only have a Linux box to start, you probably already know how to format the microSD card. Since I run a Mac, I just used the built-in Disk Utility and formatted as \"MS-DOS (FAT),\" which is really FAT32. \r\n\r\n2. **Install the operating system:** Installing software on a Raspberry Pi can be mildly complicated. I suggest using their [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md) install manager to make it painless. Just follow the link for [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md), download the files and copy them to your FAT32 microSD card and boot. It really is that easy to get started.\r\n\r\n3. **Update Raspberry Pi:** \r\n\r\nAdd \"en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\" to the locale list and set your time zone and then reboot: \r\n```\r\nsudo raspi-config\r\nsudo reboot\r\n```\r\nKeep everything fresh:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get upgrade\r\n```\r\nInstall dependances:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libssl-dev libboost-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Assemble the Raspberry Pi:** I chose to install NOOBS to make installing Raspberry Pi easier. NOOBS is kind of a boot manager/OS selector all in one that makes getting started with Raspberry Pi super easy. Judge me all you want, it's cool, but I went that route and it was as easy as advertised.\r\n\r\n4. **Boot and Configure the Raspberry Pi:**\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, don't install any of the wallet software. This is just a full node to help relay transactions, etc. It also makes the installation easier. Feel free to use one of the countless other free wallets out there.\r\nAs you are running all of the apt-get commands in the tutorial - add this one to the end: sudo apt-get install libtool (you will need it and the main article doesn't cover it, but it is in the comments)\r\nWhen you clone the git repository, change the version to the current version (in my case 0.10)\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn the end, it only took about 1-2 hours to get everything set up and then another 36-48 hours to have the blockchain sync'd up. \r\n\r\nLike this information and want to tip me:\r\n\r\n![Bitcoin Tip Address](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dcarns/Public/bitcoinaddress.png)","google":"UA-62136133-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
