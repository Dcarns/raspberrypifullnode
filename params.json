In order to run efficiently and effectively, it needs peers....and the more the better. This tutorial will describe how to create a \"full node\" (a Bitcoin service that contains the full blockchain and allows transactions to propagate throughout the Bitcoin network via peers). For a detailed explanation for why this is important you can read this article [about Bitcoin full nodes](https://medium.com/@lopp/bitcoin-nodes-how-many-is-enough-9b8e8f6fd2cf).\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample text\r\nExample two\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use.

I feel like it is being a good bitcoin citizen to run a full node. Some reasons why here. I wanted to use a Raspberry Pi because it is low cost, generates little heat, draws little power, and can run \"in the basement\" silently without having to think about it.\r\n\r\nI am going to assume that if you are reading this to create your own Raspberry Pi bitcoin full node, then you already know a fair amount about linux, electronics, and running tools like SSH. If not, I am probably going to skip over some helpful steps, which might be irritating. Sorry about that, but I am writing this as a \"quick guide\" for folks already in the know.\r\n\r\nResources Used\r\n\r\nBought a Raspberry Pi 2 - Model B (~$35)\r\nMicroSD card with 64 GB of storage (~$25)\r\nTemporarily you will need a keyboard and monitor that supports HDMI to make things easier. You don't need this technically, but it sure makes the initial config process much easier.\r\nMirco USB charger that you can dedicate to the Raspberry Pi\r\nWill install Raspbian\r\nWill follow basic guidelines here (great write up, but I found a few details lacking since the write up is now a few months old, my notes below brings things current and reflects comments made in the OP's comment thread)\r\nIn Practice\r\n\r\nThe guide listed above is quite good. Here are some things that would have made it easier.\r\n\r\n64 GB MicroSD card: The blockchain is growing quickly, so I felt 64 GB was a better size of storage. The card came formatted as exfat, instead of fat32. The SDformatter app they recommend only formatted as exfat, so what to do? Since I run a Mac, I just used the built-in Disk Utility and formatted as \"MS-DOS (FAT),\" which is really fat32. \r\nI chose to install NOOBS to make installing Raspberry Pi easier. NOOBS is kind of a boot manager/OS selector all in one that makes getting started with Raspberry Pi super easy. Judge me all you want, it's cool, but I went that route and it was as easy as advertised.\r\nIn my opinion, don't install any of the wallet software. This is just a full node to help relay transactions, etc. It also makes the installation easier. Feel free to use one of the countless other free wallets out there.\r\nAs you are running all of the apt-get commands in the tutorial - add this one to the end: sudo apt-get install libtool (you will need it and the main article doesn't cover it, but it is in the comments)\r\nWhen you clone the git respository, change the version to the current version (in my case 0.10)\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn the end, it only took about 1-2 hours to get everything set up and then another 36-48 hours to have the blockchain sync'd up. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
